<p>Thursday evening I organized a meetup called Data Science: Inconvenient
Truths where the amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/dydt">Diyang Tang</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/clarecorthell">Clare Corthell</a>, and
<a href="https://twitter.com/elenatej">Elena Grewal</a> told great stories about
things that have gone wrong when doing machine learning or data
analysis.</p>
<p>Elena gave a talk (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THBtcS7Wwss">video of a previous version</a>)
about common mistakes you can make when running experiments. I was super
excited to hear her talk because I&#x2019;m working on an experiment right now
at work and trying to interpret the results. The whole talk is great &#x2013;
it has really good examples of experiments Airbnb has worked on &#x2013; and
you should watch it, but I want to talk about the very small part where
she mentions A/A
testing.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing">A/B testing</a>!
But I&#x2019;d never heard of A/A testing before, didn&#x2019;t really understand
what she meant at the time, and didn&#x2019;t manage to ask. (pro tip: ask
questions when you have them :)). I slept on it, and I now think a) that
I get it and b) it&#x2019;s really simple and c) that it&#x2019;s SUPER COOL AND MAYBE
USEFUL TO ME.</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s pretend I have a widget store, and that I&#x2019;m running an experiment
where I have a Great Idea that I think will sell WAY MORE WIDGETS. I&#x2019;ve
rolled out my Great Idea to 33% of users, and I have a gorgeous
dashboard that says that my Great Idea group has 2% higher sales than my
other group, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/a-a-testing-good.png"></p>
<p>A 2% increase in sales is a pretty big deal! But how do I know that
these results are actually significant? One great way is to do
statistics &#x2013; Dan McKinley built this calculator which you can see
<a href="http://www.experimentcalculator.com/">here</a> that makes some assumptions
and tells you how long you&#x2019;ll need to run your experiment for to see
statistical significance.</p>
<p>But let&#x2019;s say you want to get a rough sense for whether or not your
results might be significant without doing statistics.</p>
<p>This is where A/A testing comes in! The idea here is to compare two
sets of users in the same experimental group and see how high the
variation is. So instead of having a Great Idea group and a Control
Group, we&#x2019;ll use <strong>two</strong> control groups. And then we might see something
like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/a-a-testing-bad.png"></p>
<p>Suddenly, the group we&#x2019;re experimenting on doesn&#x2019;t look so good anymore.
It looks like any difference is likely to be just because of random
noise. If we&#x2019;d instead seen something like this, we&#x2019;d be much more
likely to believe that the Great Idea is actually doing well:</p>
<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/a-a-testing-looks-better.png"></p>
<p>I like this because it seems like it can give you a rough sense for how
significant your results are without having to decide on a statistical
model. And it&#x2019;s super intuitive! A question like &#x201C;if we compare two
groups of this size with the same characteristics, do we naturally see a
lot of variation?&#x201D; is a great smoke test.</p>
<p>Once I got off a plane and looked up what A/A testing actually is, I
found out the graph above has a name! It&#x2019;s called A/A/B testing, and A/A
testing is when you literally just run an experiment where both groups
are the same :)</p>
