The <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/16/politics/mueller-russia-indictments-election-interference/index.html" target="_blank">special counsel&apos;s Office introduced to the public</a> a Russia-based company with an amorphous name, the Internet Research Agency. Mueller detailed in his court filings how the IRA, two other companies operating under the name &quot;Concord&quot; and 13 Russians allegedly executed an elaborate social media propaganda conspiracy in 2016.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Some traveled to the US, got in touch with grassroots political operatives and campaign officials, then created fake online accounts to spread misinformation across Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter. One of those Russians directing the operation, Mueller alleged, was a catering executive and businessman named  Yevgeny Prigozhin, an oligarch so close to Putin he&apos;s often described as &quot;Putin&apos;s chef.&quot;</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">The allegations unmasked the extent to which misinformation had infiltrated the American political psyche, driving conservatives and liberals further away from one another. The Russians allegedly <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/18/politics/voter-suppression-polling/index.html" target="_blank">encouraged black voters</a> to skip voting in the 2016 election, Muslim voters to demonstrate for Clinton, and Trump supporters in Florida, New York and Pennsylvania to rally.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">At one point, one of the Russian co-conspirators had an American hold a sign in front of the White House that wished Prigozhin a happy 55th birthday.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Concord Management and Consulting, the parent company of Prigozhin&apos;s catering business, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/05/politics/russian-company-mueller-investigation/index.html" target="_blank">was indicted in the case</a> and has tapped a US law firm to fight the case on its behalf. The Russian company says it&apos;s not guilty. That challenge is ongoing. The defense team continues <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/07/politics/mueller-judge-rebuke/index.html" target="_blank">to try to pry open evidence</a> in the case for its clients to see. At the same time, the prosecutors are daring Prigozhin to come to the US and face the court.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">In June 2018, Mueller <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/13/politics/russia-investigation-indictments/index.html" target="_blank">landed another indictment</a> against Russian government-backed operatives. The new case accused 12 military intelligence officers of hacking Democratic officials in 2016. This case had long been expected when Mueller opened it, since it essentially bolstered a January 2017 report by US intelligence agencies that detailed how the Russian government orchestrated the attack on the Democrats and Clinton&apos;s campaign.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Mueller&apos;s filings allege that the Russians, after looting the political computers and accounts, released batches of emails themselves online, and sent some to WikiLeaks for maximum political effect. The email releases came as a bombshell days before the Democratic National Convention in 2016, and again on the same day in October 2016 that an &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; tape of Trump bragging about grabbing women sexually went public. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">The leak before the convention ultimately forced the resignation of DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who came under fire for favoring Clinton over her primary challenger Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. This was the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/07/politics/george-papadopoulos-interview-documentary/index.html" target="_blank">&quot;dirt&quot; Papadopoulos had heard about</a>, that Mueller had tracked down in full by July 2018. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Six months later, at the end of 2018, Mueller tied the hackers to a willingness among more Trump campaign advisers to get that same dirt. But before he got to that, Mueller had more to reveal.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>Turning the Screws</h3></div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Mueller&apos;s prosecutors plodded along with their court filings in Manafort and Gates&apos; proceeding. Week by week, from October 2017 and then going forward, they used the court record to trickle out damning details that would squeeze Gates and Manafort closer to cooperation. As the two tried to get out from their house arrest restrictions, prosecutors dug into their banking history, making it harder for the men to find millions of dollars they could use as collateral for bail. The prosecutors changed and added to their indictments, making it clear how much they knew. The defendants&apos; legal bills skyrocketed.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Manafort&apos;s defense team at one point, in April 2018, unsuccessfully <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/19/politics/mueller-rosenstein-hasnt-gone-rogue/index.html" target="_blank">challenged Mueller&apos;s approach</a>, saying the special counsel had no authority to pursue Manafort&apos;s long-ago crimes in Ukraine when he should be focused on Russia and the election.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">But prosecutor Michael Dreeben let on that Manafort&apos;s work in Ukraine may connect back to Russia. &quot;Here you have somebody who was a campaign official in the Trump campaign, that he had longstanding ties to Russia-backed politicians in the Ukraine,&quot; Dreeben said on behalf of Mueller at a court hearing. &quot;What were the nature of those connections? Did they provide means for surreptitious communications? Did they provide back channels to Russia? Investigators will naturally look at those things.&quot;</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">To bolster this argument, Dreeben relied on what may be the<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/03/politics/read-rosenstein-aug-2-memo/index.html" target="_blank"> single most important document</a> made public so far in the Mueller investigation. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had written a memo for Mueller two-and-a-half months after his appointment in 2017. This became known as the &quot;August 2 memo&quot; and spelled out exactly who and what Mueller should investigate, including Manafort&apos;s years of financial ties in Ukraine and communications with Russians in 2016. The three-page memo that prosecutors revealed in the court filing is still largely redacted. No charge related to the allegation against Manafort&apos;s efforts in 2016 has been brought.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>Gates flips</h3></div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">The special counsel&apos;s office found other ways to bear down on Manafort: line up cooperators against him and get him sent to jail. Ultimately, Mueller landed the man who could be the most damaging witness against Manafort, his former partner Gates, who proved to be the star witness.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Gates&apos; house arrest in Richmond had been a burden for him, his wife and four children. He&apos;d struggled with financing his legal fees as he fought his charges alongside Manafort, his long-time boss.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">While keeping the public front that he was preparing for trial, Gates secretly hired a top Washington defense attorney <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/23/politics/rick-gates-new-attorney-mueller-russia-investigation/index.html" target="_blank">to negotiate a deal</a> with Mueller beginning in January 2018. The next month, Gates&apos; new defense lawyer publicly announced his role the night before Gates walked into court to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/23/politics/gates-guilty-plea-mueller-russia/index.html" target="_blank">plead guilty</a> to a much-reduced pair of crimes. He agreed to cooperate and began spilling what he knew of Manafort over more than 20 interview sessions with Mueller, his lawyer has said in court filings.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">And he prepared to help the prosecution in the trial of his former boss.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>Manafort march to trial</h3></div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">About a month before Manafort was set to go to trial, prosecutors revealed they had followed conversations between him and his Russian associate Konstantin Kilimnik <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/13/politics/manafort-witness-tampering-names/index.html" target="_blank">as they attempted</a> to get in touch with their lobbying contacts and shape what they might tell investigators. As a result, both Kilimnik, now living in Moscow, and Manafort were <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/08/politics/paul-manafort-indictment-robert-mueller/index.html" target="_blank">indicted for witness tampering</a>. A federal judge revoked Manafort&apos;s house arrest, putting him in near-solitary detention in Virginia. He has stayed under those conditions since then.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Kilimnik also surfaced when another witness was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/05/politics/alex-van-der-zwaan-deported/index.html" target="_blank">charged with lying</a>: Alex van der Zwaan, a Dutch lawyer who worked with Manafort and Gates on a public relations strategy in Ukraine. In a filing detailing how van der Zwaan covered up what he knew about communications in 2016 between Kilimnik and his Ukrainian lobbying partners, Mueller slipped in a key detail the FBI had learned: In 2016, Kilimnik had ties to Russian intelligence.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">  </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Manafort&apos;s trial began in Alexandria, Virginia in late July 2018. Prosecutors detailed the trappings of Manafort&apos;s luxurious life -- fine clothes, expensive rugs, landscapers and contractors -- to outline how he got rich in Ukraine, then hid the money in foreign bank accounts and used the cash to support his lavish spending. They showed dozens of emails, including one where Manafort wrote to Gates &quot;WTF? ... You told me you were on top of this,&quot; regarding keeping his tax payments artificially low.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Gates took the stand against his former boss over three days of the trial. The questioning badly damaged Gates&apos; credibility, after he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/06/politics/paul-manafort-trial-rick-gates-donald-trump/index.html" target="_blank">admitted to stealing</a> from Manafort &#x2014; possibly from the Trump political operation, too &#x2014; and said he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/07/politics/paul-manafort-trial-day-six/index.html" target="_blank">had an affair</a>. But the damage was worse for Manafort. Gates detailed how Manafort had orchestrated years of financial fraud.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">After deliberating for about four days, on August 21, the jury <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/07/politics/paul-manafort-trial-day-six/index.html" target="_blank">convicted Manafort</a> on eight financial fraud charges. The jurors couldn&apos;t agree unanimously on 10 other financial charges &#x2014; but among them, only one juror had doubt of Manafort&apos;s guilt.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">In an extraordinary bit of timing, the same hour a jury in Virginia read its guilty verdict for Manafort, Trump&apos;s long-time lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to several financial crimes including tax fraud and campaign finance violations. Crucially, in his plea, Cohen <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/21/politics/michael-cohen-plea-deal-talks/index.html" target="_blank">implicated the President</a>, whom Cohen told the court had directed him to pay hush money in the final days of the campaign to women who were alleging affairs with Trump. Trump has denied the affairs.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">In the span of an hour, Mueller had secured a conviction of Trump&apos;s former campaign manager and the long-time personal lawyer to Trump had turned against the President. Cohen began meeting with Mueller&apos;s team and eventually pleaded guilty to an additional lying charge. Mueller&apos;s subsequent case against Cohen revealed that the Trump Organization and Trump&apos;s family had worked on a plan to develop a Trump Tower in Moscow throughout the first half of 2016 while Trump campaigned for the presidency &#x2014; much further into 2016 than Cohen had testified to Congress in 2017 and that Trump publicly claimed.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>Things speed up</h3></div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">With Manafort damaged and Cohen on board, Mueller moved many of his cases toward their final positions. Manafort was headed for a second trial in DC about his Ukrainian lobbying and dozens among Washington&apos;s elite were lined as possible witnesses. Manafort &#x2014; after holding prosecutors off for 11 months &#x2014; finally admitted to his crimes in September 2018 and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/14/politics/paul-manafort-guilty-plea/index.html" target="_blank">agreed to cooperate </a>with Mueller.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Papadopoulos&apos; and Flynn&apos;s criminal cases also fast-tracked to a close in the fall of 2018. Prosecutors said Papadopoulos had <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/17/politics/papadopoulos-jail-time-special-counsel/index.html" target="_blank">never really been helpful </a>to them and had even thwarted their ability to question the mysterious foreign professor who knew about the Russians&apos; &quot;dirt&quot; on Clinton before it was released. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/07/politics/george-papadopoulos-sentencing-hearing/index.html" target="_blank">Papadopoulos got two weeks </a>in prison.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Flynn, on the other hand, had proven more useful. Mueller&apos;s team <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/04/politics/flynn-mueller-filing/index.html" target="_blank">told a federal judge </a>their well-known cooperator deserved no jail time because he had contributed substantially to ongoing investigations.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Flynn&apos;s cooperation &quot;likely affected the decisions of related firsthand witnesses to be forthcoming&quot; with investigators, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/14/politics/mueller-team-responds-to-flynn/index.html" target="_blank">Mueller&apos;s team wrote</a>.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">With that assertion about other witnesses, Mueller put a point on what had become most perilous for so many defendants during the probe: Significant lies would be charged as crimes.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Flynn readied for <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/18/politics/michael-flynn-sentencing-mueller-russia-probe/index.html" target="_blank">his sentencing in December</a>. The hearing started like any other, with prosecutors and defense counsel on friendly terms. But the judge, Emmet Sullivan of the US District Court for the District of Columbia, came ready with tough questions. Sullivan was appalled by Flynn&apos;s actions, especially while the military leader sat in the West Wing speaking with the FBI. Sullivan asked whether Flynn could have been charged with treason. Did Flynn realize how he had disgraced the American flag?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">The special counsel&apos;s office said no, treason was never a line Flynn crossed-- and Sullivan said he had misunderstood the timeline of Flynn&apos;s private lobbying. But Sullivan&apos;s lecture left its mark. Flynn&apos;s attorneys realized the peril for their client in that charged moment and asked the judge not to sentence him that day. Flynn has finished cooperating with the investigation, prosecutors have said, but may still be of use as a witness in another case brought by the Justice Department against his former lobbying partner. Flynn&apos;s sentencing has not yet been rescheduled.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Cohen, too, received a sentence. He&apos;ll go to prison in May <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/12/politics/michael-cohen-sentencing/index.html" target="_blank">for almost three years </a>for his financial fraud crimes. For lying to Congress, he got two months in prison, though that time won&apos;t make the time he serves lengthier.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">At Cohen&apos;s sentencing, also in December, Mueller prosecutor Jeannie Rhee spoke about &quot;core Russia-related issues under investigation&quot; for which Cohen gave &quot;credible and reliable&quot; information. This statement still hasn&apos;t been explained. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">But what Cohen knows and did for Trump has clearly been a live current throughout Mueller&apos;s tenure. The special counsel&apos;s office got access to his campaign-time and earlier emails beginning in July 2017- two months after Mueller&apos;s appointment. Other parts of Justice Department investigations involving Cohen are still under seal. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">There are additional unresolved questions. Cohen has alleged in public testimony to Congress that he overheard Trump and Roger Stone speaking during the campaign about Wikileaks emails that could hurt the Democrats. Trump and Stone have denied the conversation happened.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>Stone zone</h3></div><div class="el__embedded el__embedded--fullwidth"><div class="el__image--fullwidth js__image--fullwidth"><div><img class="media__image media__image--responsive" alt="" data-src-mini="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190301145734-restricted-russia-mueller-report-mainbar-stone-small-169.jpg" data-src-xsmall="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190301145734-restricted-russia-mueller-report-mainbar-stone-medium-plus-169.jpg" data-src-small="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190301145734-restricted-russia-mueller-report-mainbar-stone-large-169.jpg" data-src-medium="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190301145734-restricted-russia-mueller-report-mainbar-stone-exlarge-169.jpg" data-src-large="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190301145734-restricted-russia-mueller-report-mainbar-stone-super-169.jpg" data-src-full16x9="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190301145734-restricted-russia-mueller-report-mainbar-stone-full-169.jpg" data-src-mini1x1="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190301145734-restricted-russia-mueller-report-mainbar-stone-small-11.jpg" data-demand-load="not-loaded" data-eq-pts="mini: 0,  xsmall: 221,  small: 308,  medium: 461,  large:  781" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7"><div class="img__preloader"></div><noscript><img alt="" class="media__image" src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190301145734-restricted-russia-mueller-report-mainbar-stone-large-169.jpg"></noscript></div></div></div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">With seven defendants sentenced or heading that direction and two dozen Russians charged, Mueller had one more case to unlock.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Stone, Manafort&apos;s former lobbying partner-turned-Republican spin doctor, awoke to a swarm of FBI agents on his lawn in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on January 25, 2019. CNN had tracked the grand jury foot traffic for months and positioned a camera crew on Stone&apos;s lawn early that morning, with the possibility an indictment was coming. &quot;FBI, warrant,&quot; the heavily armed agents yelled as they knocked on Stone&apos;s door just after 6 a.m. that day.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">The arrest caught on tape became one of the most viral moments of Mueller&apos;s work. Stone had been charged under seal the day before by the grand jury in the DC courthouse for obstruction, lying during a congressional proceeding and threatening witnesses who might have contradicted his congressional statements. Mueller alleged that Stone attempted to reach WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign about the stolen Democratic emails and that Stone wanted to understand the &quot;dirt&quot; the hackers found before new batches dropped. The most tantalizing allegation Mueller leveled against Stone was that he was &quot;contacted by&quot; senior Trump campaign staffers also keen on learning about what WikiLeaks might drop to hurt Clinton.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">The Stone criminal case is ongoing. Stone has pleaded not guilty and is under strict orders not to speak publicly about the case, the court or Mueller. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>&apos;Heart&apos; of the Investigation</h3></div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Just after Thanksgiving 2018, prosecutors revealed <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/26/politics/paul-manafort-court-filing-russia-investigation/index.html" target="_blank">another bombshell development</a>: They believed Manafort was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/07/politics/paul-manafort-robert-mueller-donald-trump/index.html" target="_blank">lying to them and the grand jury</a>. This left Manafort with little leverage. He was already in jail and no longer useful to prosecutors. It was time for him to be sentenced.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Manafort, now grayed after eight months in jail and using a wheelchair, said he never intended to lie. Prosecutors submitted more than 800 pages of evidence suggesting he did, and the judge agreed.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">In a filing leading up to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/13/politics/paul-manafort-robert-mueller/index.html" target="_blank">the decision</a>, Manafort&apos;s attorneys redacted their document badly, allowing the public to copy and read text beneath the blacked-out sections in digital copies.  That text said Manafort had discussed with Kilimnik about a Ukraine peace plan and had shared 2016 polling data with him. The polling data revelation, especially, sent the Trump camp dialing back their blanket &quot;no collusion&quot; claims.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">&quot;I never said there was no collusion between the campaign, or people in the campaign,&quot; Trump&apos;s personal defense attorney Rudy Giuliani said on CNN in response to the Manafort filing. &quot;I said the President of the United States.&quot;</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">  </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">In one of the hearings about the lies, Mueller prosecutor Andrew Weissmann gave one more nod to where Mueller&apos;s been headed all along, which has still not been revealed in full. Manafort and Kilimnik had met on August 2, 2016, at a cigar bar in Manhattan while Manafort led the Trump campaign. They talked about their old contacts in Ukraine and about a policy idea for peace that touched on US sanctions against Russia -- the same idea Flynn had discussed with Kislyak after the election.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Judge Jackson pressed the special counsel&apos;s office on its <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/15/politics/paul-manafort-mueller-motive-analysis/index.html" target="_blank">apparent obsession </a>with Kilimnik&apos;s efforts. &quot;Why is that important?&quot; she asked.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Weissmann responded with an answer that&apos;s still largely redacted in the court file. He began by saying, &quot;Okay. So, I mean, this goes to the larger view of what we think is going on, and what we think the motive here is.&quot; Kilimnik had a Russian intelligence connection, Weissmann reminded her. Then he turned to Manafort, saying, &quot;There is an in-person meeting at an unusual time for somebody who is the campaign chairman to be spending time, and to be doing it in person. That meeting and what happened at that meeting is of significance to the special counsel.&quot;</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">It was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/07/politics/paul-manafort-hearing-kilimnik/index.html" target="_blank">the &quot;heart&quot; of the investigation</a>, he added.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Prosecutors have yet to close the loop on whether this meeting of great significance led them to something larger.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">But they did earn hefty penalties time for Manafort. The former Trump campaign chairman was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/03/13/paul-manafort-dc-court-murray-dnt-lead-vpx.cnn" target="_blank">sentenced to a total of 7.5 years in prison</a>, and is giving up $35 million of his assets in forfeiture to the US government and restitution to victims.  </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">In his final report, Mueller is poised to answer this: Do Manafort and Kilimnik, Stone and WikiLeaks, Flynn and Papadopoulos, the hackers and the troll farm, and the Trump campaign and the Russian government have more than lies and coincidences in common?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">The answers, for now, are still under seal.</div></div><p class="zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer"></p></div><div
